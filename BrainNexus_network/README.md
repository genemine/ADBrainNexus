BrainNexus is a brain-specific functional gene network constructed by integrating heterogeneous genomic interaction data mainly including gene coexpression networks for human brains. Other interaction data include protein-protein interaction from MINT, IntAct, and BioGRID, shared 3â€™ UTR microRNA binding motif from MSigDB, and co-occurrence of transcription factor binding sites from Jaspar. The network was built using the state-of-the-art XGBoost method. In this network, a node represents a gene and the edge represents the CFP that two genes function in the same pathway.
